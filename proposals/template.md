Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed

Motivation

Why is this pep being created, who does it target, what business value does it have (high level)

Specification

The proposal. Include relevant points of interest, a set of concrete goals, changes to the systems. A reader should be able to understand what is being proposed to change, and a developer should have a reasonable chance of implementing the feature based on this description. For the largest PEPs, consider breaking pieces out into their own dependent PEPs

Backwards Compatibility

List any implications to existing Origin, Enterprise, or Online systems. Describe how this feature becomes available. Describe how older clients will react to this change.

Rationale

The technical rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other products.

The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
